# UX User Experience:

## User stories:

### First Time Visitor Goals:
    -As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation

    -As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content

### Returning Visitor Goals:
    -As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have

## Design:

### Colour Scheme:
    -The main colours used are Purple for the text, icons & clicking text boxes, 
    a light pink for hovering over navbar and icons and bluish white hue to the background.

### Typography:
    -The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif 
    as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the 
    site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both 
    aesthically appealing and appropriate.

### Imagery:
    -The imagery was important as I need to show the collectives Logo, the artists themselves
    and merchandise they wished to sell on the website. I feel the collectives artwork
    is original and gets across the energy the collective emit

## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section:

### First Time Visitor Goals:

#### As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation:

    -Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a Hero Image
    and a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. 
    Underneath there is an About section with Text about the history of the collective.

    -The user has can scroll down and see where the collective are playing their latest shows. 

#### As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content:

    The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of 
    each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will 
    end up at clearly.
    
    On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the 
    user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

### Returning Visitor Goals:


#### As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have:

    The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.

    Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message 
    the organisation on social media.

    The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page.

    Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily 
    get back to the website.


#### As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Social Media links so that I can follow and interact with the artists latest posts:

    The Social media links can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user 
    and more information can be found on these pages.


### Frequent User Goals:


#### As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added merchandise to the website:

    The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click 
    the merchandise page and check to see if new merchandise has been added.  

#### As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if the artist is playing new shows:

    The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily 
    check the bottom of the landing page.


## Furthur Testing:

    -The Website was tested on Google Chrome & Safari 

    -It was viewed on a variety of devices such a Laptop, Iphone 11, Ipad and Oneplus5

    -A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

    -My brother was asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or 
    user experience issues.

## Known Bugs

    -The hero image would bounce down before allowing the navbar to scroll by and fix position.
    To correct this I added a ToggleClass of extra padding to the Jquery to stop this from happening.

    -The same bouncing issue became to happen when the website would respond with small screens.
    To correct this I wrote a media query to cancel out the extra padding on screen sizes smaller
    than 992px.
